# Stopwatch

A simple stopwatch designed for rubik's cube enthusiasts. It can also be used in other ways you can think of!

This project is made by me, a student who is interested in code. So I would like to apologize for how my code was made.

### Features
* Stopwatch which can be controlled by keyboard(SPACE for start/stop, R for reset)
* Timer for cube inspection (not compatible for mobile phones)


# Enjoy
